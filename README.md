## 🚀 Installation Options
You can use the Bookmark Manager in **two ways**:

---

# ✅ Option 1: Load as Chrome Extension (Developer Mode)

### 1️⃣ Download
- Go to **Releases**: https://github.com/rdxrahul12/Bookmark-Manager-Homepage/releases  
- Download `bookmark-manager-extension.zip`  
- Extract it into a permanent folder (e.g., `C:/Extensions/BookmarkManager`)  

### 2️⃣ Enable Developer Mode
- Open Chrome → visit: `chrome://extensions/`
- Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top-right)

### 3️⃣ Load Unpacked Extension
- Click **Load unpacked**
- Select the extracted folder
- Done! Open a new tab to enjoy your Bookmark Manager 🎉

⚠️ **Do NOT delete the folder** after loading it — Chrome needs it permanently.

---

# ✅ Option 2: Use via “New Tab Redirect” Extension (Recommended – Easier)

If you don’t want to enable Developer Mode, use this simple method.

### 1️⃣ Install New Tab Redirect
Install this Chrome Web Store extension:

- Open **New Tab Redirect** settings  
- Enter this URL: https://rdxrahul12.github.io/Bookmark-Manager-Homepage/

- Save  
- Open a new tab → Your Bookmark Manager loads instantly 🎉

💡 *This method does not require Developer Mode or ZIP files.*

---

## 🧰 Usage
